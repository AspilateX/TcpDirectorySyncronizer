## Please try to follow these guidelines when contributing to this project

* Keep your pull requests as small as possible: I don't want to review changes to hundreds of files
* Pull requests shouldn't tackle multiple things at the same time: Don't mix new feature X with refactoring of Y
* A pull request should not break existing features
* Big features should be delivered in multiple pull requests (see above)
* Everything you've made require some tests, so no one is upset of getting bugs from you
